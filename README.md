# Kattis

My takes on a few problems on [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com).

I have used the site to improve my problem solving skills, better my understanding of fundamentals, and explore various libraries. I have also used Kattis as a tool for learning and practicing new programming languages.

*NB!* In the Go directory you'll find `library.go`. This is not the solution to a problem called library, but a tiny library I wrote to make parsing and problem-solving a tad bit easier :slightly_smiling_face:

At the time of writing this, I have 668.5 points (1st in my [county](https://open.kattis.com/countries/NOR/18) and 4th in my [university](https://open.kattis.com/universities/uio.no)), whilst maintaining healthy competition with my friends [Jakob](https://github.com/jakobkhansen) and [Sarek](https://github.com/sarsko).
