# Kattis

My takes on a few problems on [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com).

I have used the site to improve my problem solving skills, better my understanding of fundamentals, and explore various libraries. Currently having fun with Kotlin! <br/>
As the time of writing this, I have 270.5 points and stand 11th on my university's [ranklist](https://open.kattis.com/universities/uio.no).
