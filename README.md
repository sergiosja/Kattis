# Kattis

My takes on a few problems on [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com).

I have used the site to improve my problem solving skills, better my understanding of fundamentals, and explore various libraries. Currently learning the basics of Prolog! <br/>
At the time of writing this, I have 503.1 points and sit in 8th place in my [university](https://open.kattis.com/universities/uio.no), and 2nd in my [county](https://open.kattis.com/countries/NOR/18).
