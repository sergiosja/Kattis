# Kattis

My takes on a few problems on [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com).

I have used the site to improve my problem solving skills, better my understanding of fundamentals, and explore various libraries. <br/>
I currently have 245.6 points and stand 13th on my university's [ranklist](https://open.kattis.com/universities/uio.no).
