# Kattis

My takes on a few problems on [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com).

I have used the site to improve my problem solving skills, better my understanding of fundamentals, and explore various libraries. I have also used Kattis as a tool for learning new programming languages.

For 2022 I have set out to learn (at least the basics of) Go, in addition to improving my Kotlin skills. Therefore, most of this year's solutions will be in these two languagesðŸ˜„

At the time of writing this, I have 600.2 points (1st in my [county](https://open.kattis.com/countries/NOR/18) and 5th in my [university](https://open.kattis.com/universities/uio.no)), whilst maintaining healthy competition with my friends [Jakob](https://github.com/jakobkhansen) and [Sarek](https://github.com/sarsko).
