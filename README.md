# Kattis

My takes on a few problems on [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com).

I have used the site to improve my problem solving skills, better my understanding of fundamentals, and explore various libraries. I have also used Kattis as a tool for learning and practicing new programming languages.

At the time of writing this, I have 635.0 points (2st in my [county](https://open.kattis.com/countries/NOR/18) and 4th in my [university](https://open.kattis.com/universities/uio.no)), whilst maintaining healthy competition with my friends [Jakob](https://github.com/jakobkhansen) and [Sarek](https://github.com/sarsko).
